## Hotkeys

- `q`/`w`/`e` - Set the rate to one of the three most common<sup>1</sup> speeds, see: `speedQ`/`speedW`/`speedE`.
- `r` - Set the new speed directly.
- `d` - Toggle between the two recent speeds.
- `o` - Open a file.
- `space` - Toggle playback.
- `s` - Toggle the backwards autostep mode. In this mode `q`/`e`/`w`/`d` will also step back `timeShiftInSeconds=5`.
- `h`/`l` - Step `timeStepSizeInSeconds=5` (relatively to the user time) backwards and forward respectively.
